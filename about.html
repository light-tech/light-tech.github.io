        <h1 class="content-head is-center">About Us</h1>

<p>Ironically, as technology progresses and our chips
get faster and faster, the world becomes less and less
efficient. That is because there is now little incentive
for developers to optimize their code compared to the
situation at the infancy of computing. The most prominant
examples of this trend are</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Since the early 2000s,
the company made a strategic shift to C# to replace the
dominant programming language of choice C++. While C# does
offer advantages over C++, it suffers on performance and
the program size becomes significantly bigger. Visual Studio,
the integrated development environment (IDE) of choice
for Microsoft's Windows platform, is getting bigger and
bigger while adding little compared to versions released
years ago. Skype used to be a 20MB app. Now it was 100MB.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Java</strong>: A huge percent of software is
written in Java. The "security", "portability", "easy to learn"
etc. of Java comes at the expense of, you guessed it,
efficiency. Java program requires availability of the
interpreter i.e. installation of additional software.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Facebook</strong>: Look at Facebook's Messenger
app for Universal Windows Platform. The app installs on a phone
at 200MB and takes up a huge amount of RAM. (Facebook said
the minimum RAM requirement is 2GB. That is an extremely
unreasonable amount for a simplistic messaging application.)
  </li>
  <li><strong>The shift to applications using JavaScript</strong>:
An example is Visual Studio Code.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We advocate ourselves to work toward an efficient world
of technology. The name <em>Lightech</em> is partially chosen
to reflect both properties of light:
its <strong>weightlessness</strong> (note: this is rhetoric,
not true in physics) and <strong>fastest</strong> (note:
again, this is rhetoric, we do not know if this is true
in physics; it was assumed in Einstein theory though).
The third and in fact original meaning is the dedication to
innovation, as a light bulb usually used to illustrate new
and novel ideas.</p>

<p>This philosophy is reflected in every product we built.
To illustrate our point:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>LawTeX</strong>: This is our very first product,
TeX/LaTeX integrated writing environment. Not only does the
app improves on the installation weight and speed, it also
offers improvement in the traditional development workflow:
Most LaTeX editor requires user to press the button to
compile the document. LawTeX offers the ability to
automatically recompile and re-render the generated DVI
when you pause typing, saving the need to repeatedly press
button to recompile the document.
  (The same point can be said about any other IDE; though
it makes less sense to do the same for programming languages
like C/C++.)
  This is in fact the very reasons we developed LawTeX.
  </li>
  <li><strong>OnlyTube</strong>: Our efficient YouTube client.
OnlyTube prevent crashes of YouTube website on phones with
little RAM like Lumia 635. It runs at roughly 50MB of RAM
compared to 300-400MB watching the same video on browser.
It also enhances user experience:
  <ul>
    <li>Comments are loaded as you scroll down the apps
while you need to repeatedly press <em>Load more</em> on
the browser (and then scroll down to see the newly loaded
comments).
    </li>
    <li>Search results are likewise kept. On the browser,
you need to open video in new tabs (and consuming a few
hundred MB of RAM or so) and go back to search result page
again and again if you want to see another search video. This
is not possible on phone with limited RAM since opening the
video in new tab will crash the search page.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Beyond that, OnlyTube does not download video thumbnail
images, saving a huge amount of RAM and data. Imagine loading
100 search results with 100KB image each, you already consume
10MB of data.
  While we admit the official app (not available for Windows 10
anyway) looks good, we like an efficient one more. Also, we
are aware that data is probably not a concern in the US
but not everywhere else; this is another point of inefficiency
but due to users' choice instead of developers.
  At 200KB download and 800KB installed, OnlyTube beats other
YouTube options most of which weight at least 50MB installed,
not to count the amount of temporary data they saves.
  <li><strong>Git It</strong>: Our Git client. Once again,
our application is roughly 3MB installed on a Lumia 635
and 1MB on Desktop compared to 400MB full installation of
the official Git client.
  To our knowledge, this is the first Git client
available for Windows 10 Mobile platform.<br/>
  Git It fixes some design flaw of the official client such
as putting the revision history right on the front page. In
our experience, most people opened Git GUI also open the
revision history; we thus save the users a lot of redundant
mouse actions.<br/>
  Git It has consideration and optimized for touchscreen
interaction.<br/>
  We do not claim Git It to be as powerful as the official
client. However, we believe it is sufficient for a lot of
use cases; such as researcher writing papers and short
scripts (more generally, those who do not require features
such as branching and submodules).
  </li>
  <li><strong>DevMax</strong>: Our C/C++ development platform
(to write programs for Windows PC). Drawing from the
inefficiency of most C/C++ IDE available, we improvise this
tool with the goals:
  <ul>
    <li>Use as little space as possible: 800KB installed
(without compiler, a separate C++ compiler app weight roughly
30MB) compared to at least 1GB basic installation (solution
loading + editor only) of Visual Studio Community
or 300MB installation of the supposedly much more lightweight
Visual Studio Code.
    </li>
    <li>Efficient and fast: Written in C++ instead of
Java, C# or JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>Better compiler workflow: Visual Studio runs (lots of)
external processes to compile. Our C++ compiler is integrated.
This means there is no need to reload, reinitialize,
reprocesses (system headers), etc. Our hello world application
compilation is at least 10 times faster than Visual Studio.
    </li>
  </ul>
  DevMax is in fact used to develop itself (and from now on,
all of our other apps)!
  </li>
  <li><strong>ReWeB</strong>: Our web browser. ReWeB removes
images and scripts; making sites unviewable on phones with
little RAM (constant site crashing and reloading) accessible
to those phones. As a consequence, ReWeB saves precious data.
ReWeB also do not cache website to save disk space storage.
A typical Chrome installation consumes 400MB-2GB for the
browser and cached contents.
  </li>
</ul>
