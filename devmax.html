  <p>Due to our oversight of not taking into account the fact
that LLVM uses some Win32 API unsupported in the Windows Store
so that our app cannot pass the certification process, we have
to devise a solution of using a separate C++ Compiler app
instead of bundling the compiler in DevMax as originally
promised.</p>
  <p>We are sorry for all these inconvenience.</p>

  <h2>Compiling C/C++ with DevMax</h2>

  <p>Right now, the app is quite primitive so we have not
supply the UI to do all these set-up so you need to follow
these steps manually.</p>

  <p><strong>After</strong> you installed the our
<a href="https://github.com/light-tech/light-tech.github.io/releases">C++ Compiler</a> app,
navigate to
  <code>%localappdata%\Publishers\8vrbkgtyqrt4j</code>
with Windows Explorer. We shall refer to this folder as
<code>$DATA</code> subsequently. There you will see 3 folders:
  <code>C++Projects</code>,
  <code>C++Include</code>, and
  <code>C++Lib</code>. It is needless to say what the purposes
of those folders are.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Obtain Windows' C/C++ headers</strong>:
    The easiest way is to install Visual Studio 2017 for
Desktop Development. There are 2 set of headers you need to
acquire:
      <ol type="i">
        <li><i>Windows SDK headers</i>: Located in
<code>C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Include\$VERSION</code>
where <code>$VERSION</code> refers to Windows 10 SDK version such as
<code>10.0.14393.0</code>. There are 4 folders inside:
<code>shared</code>,
<code>ucrt</code>,
<code>um</code>, and
<code>winrt</code>.
For desktop (console application) development, usually we only
need <code>ucrt</code> which provides those standard C headers
such as <code>stdio.h</code>.
It is best to copy all of them to the <code>$DATA\C++Include</code>
folder.</li>
        <li><i>Microsoft Visual C++ headers</i>:
Located in <code>$VISUAL_STUDIO_INSTALL_DIR\VC\Tools\MSVC\$VERSION\include</code>
The <code>$VERSION</code> is something like <code>14.10.24728</code>.
Copy the content of this folder to something like <code>msvc</code>
in the <code>$DATA\C++Include</code> folder.
This provides you with those C++ headers such as
<code>iostream</code>.</li>
      </ol>
    <li><strong>Copy standard libraries for linking:</strong>
Again, there are two sets of <code>*.lib</code> files to copy.
The first are located in
<code>C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Lib\$VERSION\{ucrt,um}\x86</code>
and the second are in
<code>$VISUAL_STUDIO_INSTALL_DIR\VC\Tools\MSVC\$VERSION\lib\x86</code>.
You can guess their purposes. Just copy the <code>*.lib</code>
to <code>$DATA\C++Lib</code>.
<strong>TIP</strong>: Just a head-up, you only need
<code>kernel32.lib</code>,
</code>ucrt.lib</code> in the former and
</code>msvcrt.lib</code> and
<code>vcruntime.lib</code> in the latter to produce console
applications. 
    </li>

  <li><strong>Add C++ projects</strong>:
  In <code>$DATA\C++Projects</code>, create folder for each
of your project, put your source code there and
write build descriptions in <code>project.json</code>.
Try cloning
<a href="https://github.com/light-tech/DevMaxSamples.git">our repo</a>
as a starting point.</li>
</ol>

  <p>Now you should be able to build the application.</p>

  <p>Open DevMax (version 2.0 [still in certification]
required) and click on the open project button (next to the
button to open a folder). Select the project you want. Then
in <strong>Project</strong> tab, you should see a list of
build definitions that can be executed. Click
<strong>Run</strong> to run the build definition in C++ Compiler
app. You should see the build output such as compilation
warning and errors in C++ Compiler.</p>

  <h2>Question &amp; Answers</h2>
  <p><b>Q: Why don't you distribute the headers and
libraries with the app?</b></p>
  <p><i>Answer</i>: Copyright issue, of course. Those are
properties of Microsoft. If you can get a statement from
the company stating that we can freely distribute them,
we shall do that. We might distribute a non-Microsoft
C/C++ standard library in future release.</p>
  <p><b>Q: If we have to install Visual Studio anyway,
why should we use DevMax?</b></p>
  <p><i>Answer</i>: You only need to set it up once,
7-zipped the files (approximately 80MB) and you can use
it anywhere. And you don't need to do it in your machine
but a virtual machine; which avoid damaging your computer.
  </p>
  <p><b>Q: Can't you allow headers, libraries and project
to be outside of the aforementioned folders?</b></p>
  <p><i>Answer</i>: Due to severe security restrictions
imposed by Microsoft, we must do it that way.</p>
